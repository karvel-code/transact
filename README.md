# Ruby on Rails Capstone Project: Transact

- This is the capstone project of the Microverse Ruby on Rails curriculum.

- In this project, I created a cost/transaction grouping app where users can create an account with their username and add costs to specific groups or add them as ungrouped costs.

- Users can view contributions in each group.

  Some of the advanced concepts explored in this project include.

- Basic Authentication

- Used RSpec as the test suite.
